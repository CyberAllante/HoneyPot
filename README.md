# üõ°Ô∏è T-Pot Honeypot Deployment on DigitalOcean | CyberAllante

This project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio and showcases my deployment of **T-Pot**, an all-in-one honeypot platform, on a VPS hosted by DigitalOcean.  

I built this environment to **capture and analyze real-world cyberattacks** against exposed services in the wild.  
By collecting and visualizing attack data in Kibana and Elastic dashboards, I was able to see how adversaries target systems, what services they go after, and which credentials they attempt to brute-force.  

Through this project, I was able to strengthen my hands-on skills in:
- Deploying and configuring honeypot systems in the cloud
- Using Elastic Stack for security monitoring and data visualization
- Analyzing attacker behavior and generating threat intelligence

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Platform:** DigitalOcean VPS (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Honeypot Framework:** T-Pot 24.04.1
- **Monitoring & Analysis:** Kibana (Elastic stack), Attack Maps, CyberChef, SpiderFoot
- **Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with honeypots, threat data collection, and visualization.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Steps
1. Provisioned a VPS on DigitalOcean (2 CPU / 4 GB RAM).
2. Downloaded the latest **T-Pot ISO** and performed installation via SSH.
3. Allowed required firewall ports for T-Pot services.
4. Verified containerized honeypots (Cowrie, Honeytrap, ConPot, etc.) were running.
5. Connected to the Kibana dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## üìä Results & Dashboards

### Honeypot Attack Statistics
![Honeypot Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard1.png)

- Over **1,000 attacks** captured in 24 hours.
- Most attacks targeted **Honeytrap** and **Cowrie** honeypots.
- Attack sources included **United States, South Korea, Argentina, Hong Kong, Singapore**.

## üìä Custom Kibana Dashboard ‚Äì Attack Insights

![Custom Dashboard](screenshots/custom_dashboard.png)

I built a **custom Kibana dashboard** on top of T-Pot‚Äôs data to highlight real-time attack trends.  
**Panels included:**
- **Top Source IPs** ‚Äì repeated offenders by event count
- **Attacker IP Reputation** ‚Äì known attacker vs mass scanner
- **Attacks Over Time** ‚Äì spikes and volume by 30-min buckets
- **Attacks by City / Country / Port** ‚Äì who‚Äôs hitting, from where, and what they target

**Why this matters:** turns raw honeypot logs into **actionable threat intelligence** and shows my ability to design Elastic visualizations that answer security questions quickly.

<details>
<summary><strong>How I built it (quick steps)</strong></summary>

1) **Data view:** selected my T-Pot/Logstash index (e.g., `logstash-*`).  
2) **Lens Visualizations:**
   - Bar/Table: **Top values of** `source.ip` (size 10) ‚Üí metric: **Count**
   - Donut: **Terms** on `attacker.reputation` (or your equivalent field)
   - Line: X-axis `@timestamp` (auto interval), Y-axis **Count**
   - Bar/Pie: **Terms** on `geoip.city_name.keyword` and/or `geoip.country_name.keyword`
   - Bar: **Terms** on `destination.port`
3) **Dashboard:** added each panel ‚Üí saved as **‚ÄúAttack Insights (Custom)‚Äù**.

### Attack Map
![Attack Map](screenshots/attackmap.png)  

- Live visualization of incoming connections worldwide.
- Largest clusters from **North America** and **Asia**.

---

### Service Distribution
![Services](screenshots/services.png)

- Attackers attempted **FTP, SSH, Telnet, SQL, and DNS** services.
- Common brute-force attempts against SSH (`root`, `admin` users).

---

### Threat Intelligence & Suricata Alerts
![Suricata](screenshots/suricata.png)

- Top attacker networks included **Charter, UCloud, DigitalOcean, and Microsoft**.  
- Frequent attacker IPs were observed repeatedly attempting malicious traffic.  
- Suricata alerts flagged issues such as **invalid timestamps, spurious retransmissions, truncated packets, and suspicious SSH activity**.

---

## üß† Key Takeaways
- T-Pot provides an **excellent all-in-one honeypot lab** for learning threat intelligence.
- Attack traffic was captured within **minutes** of deployment, showing the scale of opportunistic scans on the internet.
- Visualization tools like Kibana and the Attack Map make analysis much more accessible.
- This project reinforced concepts in **incident response, intrusion detection, and adversary behavior analysis**.

---

## üîÆ Next Steps
- Expand honeypot monitoring with **custom dashboards**.
- Export captured data for further analysis in **Splunk** or **ELK**.
- Integrate with **SIEM/SOAR pipelines** for automation.
